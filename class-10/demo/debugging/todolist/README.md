# Project Title:  To-Do-List

A collaberative project on a "to-do list" task browser.  Similar to the way people write on a piece of paper a list of tasks that need to be done.  We created 2 list boxes.  One for daily tasks.  The other for non-daily tasks with a due date. 

## Functional website of the project.

## Getting started on your to-do list.

Add some tasks you need to perform.  Set the level on easy, medium, or hard.  This is an honor system for now.  :heavy_check_mark:

### Break down of the in's and out.

If you have a hard time remembering what tasks you need to do throughout the day and long-term tasks as well, this app is a helpful tool.  To add some fun, we incorporated a small style game into your tasks.  Basically, everytime you complete a task, you are awarded points based on difficulty.

### And coding style

This app was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript only.
