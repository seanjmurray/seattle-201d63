Communication Plan
==================

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

* We will use our Slack private group

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?

* Twice daily check-ins where each person will identify their blockers and ideas. Additionally, we have our conflict resolution plan to catch in the moment issues.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

* All ideas will have space to be heard. Avoid criticisms of ideas. Adding the question: "how are you feeling?" during twice daily check-ins.
